Example game playing web servers
===
Based on the Github project [extreme startup servers](https://github.com/steria/extreme_startup_servers) - these are simple web server apps in a variety of languages that can be used as a skeleton to get people up and running quickly with a server that will be able to respond to requests from a game-master server.
